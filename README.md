# js-security
This repo is created to draft down the details on Node.js security concerns like vulnerable packages, dependency sprawl, and build-time risks. Compared npm, yarn, pnpm, and build tools like Vite, Webpack, Turbopack. Recommended pnpm + Vite for secure builds and using SBOM (via Syft) for vulnerability tracking and compliance.
